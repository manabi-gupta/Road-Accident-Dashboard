# Road-Accident-Dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze and visualize road accident data to identify trends, high-risk areas, and key contributing factors.exc

This is going to be one of my projects for creating a dashboard regarding road Accidents.
ðŸ§­ Key Metrics (KPIs)

Total Accidents
Total Fatal Accidents
Total Casualties / Injuries
Accidents by Vehicle Type
Accidents by Weather / Road Condition
Average Accidents per Mont
Accidents by Time of Da
Top 5 States / Cities with Most Accidents

It is still in progress I have completed my data cleaning and data formatting. 

This is the before

And this is how it looks now.

Even after editing I got many other errors 
- Numbers were in text form
- Even after edinting in the power query there were still few word what were joint together when got loaded in excel, they had unwanted spaces, blanks etc
I corrected then and finallythis came out to be the final dashboard

Then I created the required pivot tables required for the Data analysis

## Key Features and Insights
The dashboard provides a high-level overview and drill-down capabilities on several critical areas:

Overall Impact: The total number of casualties is clearly displayed at 453,050.
Accident Severity: Analysis shows that the vast majority of incidents are of Slight Severity (82.9%), though there are still 3,678 Fatal and 27,537 Serious accidents.
Casualty Breakdown:
By Vehicle Type: Cars are involved in the most casualties (140,858 - 77.1%), followed by Vans/LGVs (16,168) and Motorcycles (15,414).
By Road Type: Single Carriageway roads account for the highest volume of casualties, followed by Dual Carriageway and Roundabouts.
By Road Surface: The majority of accidents occur on a Dry road surface, which is a crucial insight for focusing preventative measures.
By Light Condition: Casualties are more frequent during Daylight conditions, but a significant number still occur in Darkness (45.5K).
Area and Location: Casualties are significantly higher in Urban (112.2K) areas compared to Rural areas.
Temporal Trend: The Monthly Trend (2020) chart allows for the identification of peak accident periods throughout the year.

This is The final Interactive Dashboard

## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a vital tool for stakeholdersâ€”including government agencies, transport planners, and law enforcementâ€”to identify high-risk areas and factors. The insights can directly inform strategic decisions to improve road safety, such as targeted infrastructure improvements or public awareness campaigns.
